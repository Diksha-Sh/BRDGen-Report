As reported\nby the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD), the share of e-commerce in retail sales jumped\nfrom 16% to 19% in 2020 [58]. Similarly, forecasts by the\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development\n(OECD) suggest that global surface freight ton-kilometers may\ndouble by 2030 from their 2015 figures, with a notable 3.2-fold\nincrease expected in Asian regions [50].

In this\ncontext, developing strategies for timely and efficient delivery\nbecomes a crucial research area in urban distribution.\nTraditional freight movement methods face significant chal-\nlenges within densely populated urban areas [48]. Various\nstrategies have been proposed to ease urban traffic congestion.\nThese include expanding traditional road network capacities,\noften limited by the tight urban spaces of modern cities. The\nrise of shared mobility, expected to grow substantially, presents\na possible solution to urban transport issues [49]. Recent\nstudies have also introduced multi-objective formulations for\nelectric vehicle routing problems, including shuttle bus fleets\nat university campuses [25] and unmanned vehicle fleets in\nlarge-scale urban logistics systems [71], offering valuable\nadvancements for optimizing urban logistics. However, this\napproach primarily serves individual transportation needs,\nmaking it more suitable for residents and less comprehensive\nfor broader urban transportation dilemmas [45]. Air delivery\nsystems, especially drones, have also been recognized as a\npromising option for diverse logistical challenges [28], [29],\n[30]. Nevertheless, their adoption is hindered by air traffic\nsafety and data privacy concerns [11], [46].\nAgainst this backdrop, Underground Logistics Systems\n(ULS) have emerged as an innovative solution, offering\nnumerous benefits for urban distribution. The ULS concept\ninvolves using subterranean channels for logistics operations\nto alleviate surface traffic congestion, reduce operational costs,\nand improve delivery efficiency [60]. This novel approach,\nwhich includes using underground rail resources, represents\na significant shift in urban logistics, paving the way for\nmore sustainable and efficient urban development. ULS also\naligns with sustainable urban development goals, introducing\na transformative logistics model with modular autonomous\nvehicles and dynamic pickup and delivery systems [10], [52].\nOngoing research into ULS for nearly 3 decades has\nconsistently highlighted its considerable advantages. ULS sys-\ntems, requiring minimal surface space, offer resilience against\nextreme weather impacts on logistics, enhancing the reliability\nand safety of delivery services. Furthermore, using ULS as a\nsupplementary freight delivery method can significantly ease\nsurface transportation burdens, reducing highway maintenance\nexpenses and decreasing truck-related accidents.\nULS stands out as a sustainable option in urban logistics,\ndeserving serious consideration as a practical transportation\nmode.

The resulting decrease in ground truck traffic also\nleads to considerable environmental and economic benefits,\nsuch as lower road maintenance costs, helping to offset the\nsubstantial initial investment needed for ULS infrastructure\n[68], [73].\nOur work advances urban logistics optimization by integrat-\ning reinforcement learning with exact methods, specifically\ndesigned for ULS. While progress has been made in ULS\nnetwork design, most research focuses on isolated technolog-\nical aspects and does not address the full integration with\nsurface-level transport systems. Furthermore, many existing\nmodels rely on traditional optimization methods, which are\noften too rigid to accommodate the dynamic nature of urban\nlogistics, especially when managing the complexities of both\nunderground and surface transportation networks.

The key\ncontributions of our research are as follows:\n1) Introduction of the Vehicle Routing Problem with\nUnderground Transportation (VRP-UT): We intro-\nduce the VRP-UT model, integrating underground\nstations into the conventional vehicle routing framework.\nThis innovative model allows for more efficient urban\ndeliveries by leveraging underground transport to allevi-\nate surface-level congestion, leading to optimized route\nselection for last-mile logistics.\n2) Hybrid Q-learning with Pruning for Dynamic\nRoute Optimization: Our hybrid framework, combin-\ning Q-learning with pruning techniques, dynamically\nadjusts to changing conditions such as traffic, delays,\nand operational disruptions.

L ITERATURE REVIEW\nUrban development and the continuous expansion of\nmetropolitan areas have brought about challenges such as\ntraffic congestion, pollution, and space constraints, which not\nonly hinder the efficiency of logistics but also have significant\nnegative impacts on the environment and urban mobility [6],\n[22]. Urban logistics is crucial for ensuring the timely and\ncost-effective delivery of goods, yet conventional surface-level\ntransportation methods face limitations in addressing these\nchallenges [32]. Moreover, the integration of electric vehicles\nin urban logistics systems is an emerging solution, providing a\nmore sustainable and efficient way to navigate city infrastruc-\ntures [26]. As cities grow in population and economic activity,\nthe strain on existing logistics infrastructure intensifies, result-\ning in inefficiencies and increased operational costs [24], [51].\nThe integration of underground systems within urban logis-\ntics networks offers a promising solution and has increasingly\nbeen considered as a viable option to address urban freight\nmovement by making use of the subterranean spaces available\nin dense urban environments [16], [23]. Leveraging advanced\ninfrastructure and technological solutions, ULS can provide\nan alternative to traditional road-based delivery, helping alle-\nviate congestion, reduce pollution, and optimize the use of\nurban space [41], [69]. Early studies have focused on the\nfeasibility and implementation of ULS, exploring the technical\nand economic aspects of integrating underground transport\nsystems with urban logistics [3], [19]. While these studies\nhave established the potential benefits of ULS, they often\ndo not fully explore the integration of underground logistics\nwith surface-level transportation networks, leaving a gap in\naddressing the broader operational and strategic challenges of\nurban logistics [21], [40].\nA. Operational Optimization in Urban Logistics\nOperational optimization is crucial for enhancing the effi-\nciency and adaptability of urban logistics systems. Various\nstudies have developed frameworks for improving routing,\nscheduling, and system flexibility, focusing on the integration\nof autonomous vehicles [34], multi-objective optimization\nmethods such as truck-drone collaboration [42], and flexi-\nble routing systems [36]. These advancements help optimize\ntransportation resources and reduce operational costs in urban\nlogistics.\nBeyond operational efficiency, environmental concerns are\nincreasingly being integrated into the design and operation\nof ULS. Many urban logistics solutions now incorporate\neco-friendly practices to minimize the environmental impact\nof freight movement. The adoption of sustainable energy\nsolutions within ULS, such as electric vehicles and clean\nenergy sources, is becoming more widespread. Furthermore,\nintegrating underground logistics can significantly reduce\nsurface-level congestion, indirectly lowering vehicle emissions\nand contributing to urban sustainability [24]. Additionally,\ngreen logistics routing approaches\u2014such as eco-packaging\nand energy-efficient delivery routes [6]\u2014are key components\nof ULS, aligning operational efficiency with environmental\ngoals.\nJEONG AND SONG: OPTIMIZING URBAN LOGISTICS: VRP-UT 6395\nFig. 1. Schematic representation of the integrated urban logistics system that combines surface truck routing with an underground logistics network.\nRecent studies have examined how environmental con-\nsiderations can be integrated into ULS frameworks, with\nparticular emphasis on optimizing routing for food logistics\nsystems, which enhances the sustainability and efficiency of\nurban transportation networks [39]. For instance, Schiewe and\nSch\u00f6bel [55] explores how underground logistics systems can\nreduce urban emissions while enhancing delivery efficiency.\nSimilarly, Hulagu and Celikoglu [24] demonstrates that inte-\ngrating underground logistics with traditional surface transport\nmethods can alleviate congestion and lower carbon footprints.\nThese findings underscore the importance of combining oper-\national optimization with sustainable practices in ULS.\nB. Multi-Modal Logistics Systems\nThe integration of various transport modes within ULS\nis crucial for improving urban logistics efficiency. As urban\nareas continue to face congestion and space constraints, com-\nbining underground and surface-level transport systems has\nbecome an important research area. Recent work empha-\nsizes the integration of autonomous vehicles, drones, and\ntraditional ground-based vehicles for enhanced multi-modal\noperations [42], as well as exploring optimization techniques\nfor distributing goods within urban rail and underground\nsystems [37]. Moreover, Zheng et al.[72] have examined urban\nrail service design for collaborative passenger and freight\ntransport, optimizing logistics through the effective use of\nurban metro lines.\nIn addition to operational efficiency, sustainability is a\nkey factor in multi-modal logistics systems. Recent studies\nhave explored how ULS can reduce environmental impacts\nby integrating electric vehicles, green packaging, and sus-\ntainable energy sources into operations. Research by Hulagu\nand Celikoglu [24] highlights that integrating underground\nlogistics not only alleviates surface-level congestion but also\ncontributes to reducing carbon footprints. Moreover, eco-\nfriendly routing algorithms [6] and the use of clean energy\nvehicles are key innovations driving sustainability within urban\nlogistics systems. These advances are further supported by\nresearch, such as Schiewe and Sch\u00f6bel [55], which investigates\nhow environmental considerations can be integrated into ULS\nframeworks.\nRecent research has also focused on multi-depot and\nresource-sharing strategies in urban logistics, which are\nessential for improving ULS network efficiency. Studies\nlike Wang et al. [63], which explores resource sharing in\nmulti-depot vehicle routing, and Wang et al. [61], which exam-\nines eco-packages, highlight the critical role of sustainability\nin enhancing logistics efficiency. Furthermore, Wang et al.[64]\nand Wang et al.[62] contribute to multi-depot logistics models,\noffering new strategies for better resource allocation and time-\ndependent logistics. These studies underscore the importance\nof combining multi-modal systems with sustainable practices\nto achieve both operational optimization and reduced environ-\nmental impact.\nC. ULS Design and Optimization for Last-Mile Delivery\nThe design and optimization of ULS have been central\nto urban logistics research. Numerous studies have explored\nthe integration of underground systems with urban freight\nnetworks, proposing various models and optimization tech-\nniques. Foundational work by Hulagu and Celikoglu [22],\nHenry et al. [19], and Binsbergen and Bovy [3] has provided\nvaluable insights into the potential for integrating underground\ntransportation systems within urban freight networks. These\nearly studies addressed the technical feasibility, infrastructure\nrequirements, and operational aspects of underground systems,\nsetting the stage for further exploration of ULS.\nAs demand for efficient last-mile delivery solutions contin-\nues to rise, the design and optimization of ULS have become\neven more critical. Several studies have focused on innovations\nin underground transport systems and their integration with\nmetro systems, electric vehicles, and other above-ground trans-\nportation methods. Research by Pei et al. [51], Ma et al. [43],\nand Cui and Nelson [8] laid the groundwork for integrating\nunderground transport with urban freight networks. While\nsignificant contributions have been made, gaps remain in\ncomprehensive approaches that effectively combine the oper-\national strategies of underground logistics with surface-level\ntransportation systems. Additionally, the practical challenges\nof integration\u2014such as coordination, resource sharing, and\noperational efficiency\u2014remain underexplored.\nRecent advancements in ULS design and last-mile deliv-\nery solutions focus on optimizing distribution paths within\nurban rail systems and metro-based logistics frameworks.\nFor instance, Leng and Li [37] and Hu et al. [21] explore\nthe optimization of distribution paths for intelligent logistics\nvehicles within underground systems. Furthermore, studies by\nWei et al. [66] and Mo et al. [47] propose novel last-mile\n6396 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 5, MAY 2025\ndelivery approaches, such as self-pickup modes and optimized\nrouting within ULS frameworks. Hu et al. [20] also explore the\nuse of ULS for automated waste collection and parcel delivery,\noffering new perspectives on the versatility of underground\nlogistics in urban systems.\nDespite the advancements in ULS network design and\noptimization, several limitations remain. Current models often\nfocus on specific technological or operational aspects of ULS\nwithout fully integrating the complexities of multi-modal\nlogistics systems. The integration of underground and\nsurface-level transport systems remains underexplored, and\nmany studies focus on isolated case studies or simulations,\nlimiting the generalizability of the results. Additionally, exist-\ning research often relies on traditional optimization methods,\nwhich are not always adaptable to the dynamic nature of urban\nlogistics.\nThis study addresses these limitations by presenting a\ncomprehensive framework that integrates ULS with tradi-\ntional ground-level delivery systems. The proposed model\nincorporates multi-depot arrangements, time windows, and\ninventory constraints, providing a holistic approach to urban\nlogistics optimization. The study also introduces advanced\nmetaheuristic techniques, such as reinforcement learning and\nexact optimization methods, which offer a dynamic, timely\napproach to solving urban logistics challenges. By integrating\nunderground and surface-level logistics systems, this study\nprovides a novel solution to urban logistics problems and sets\nnew benchmarks for operational efficiency, sustainability, and\nflexibility in urban logistics systems.\nIII. P ROBLEM DESCRIPTION\nThis research introduces the VRP-UT, a novel model for\nlast-mile delivery networks. The VRP-UT extends the classical\nmulti-depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP) by incorpo-\nrating inventory constraints and time windows, while also\nleveraging underground transfer stations to optimize delivery\nroutes. The model is designed to facilitate not only deliveries\nbut also pickups, drop-offs, and inventory transfers within a\nnetwork of underground stations.\nThe VRP-UT logistics network consists of three main\ntypes of nodes: warehouses, stations, and customers. Ware-\nhouses function as inventory hubs where goods are stored and\nvehicles are loaded. Stations serve as transfer points within\nthe underground system, facilitating the movement of goods\nbetween warehouses, especially when certain products are\nunavailable at the originating warehouse. Finally, customers\nare the ultimate delivery points, often requiring goods sourced\nfrom multiple warehouses or stations.\nThe model operates under the following key assumptions:\n\u2022 Not all products are available at the originating ware-\nhouse, necessitating transfers between warehouses via\nunderground stations.\n\u2022 The underground transit system is used exclusively for\ntransfers between stations, while vehicles handle the final\ndeliveries to customers.\n\u2022 Underground transfers are constrained by fixed schedules,\nrequiring synchronization of vehicle routes with station\ntimes.\n\u2022 Surface routes are bidirectional, allowing free movement\nbetween surface nodes, but underground transfers are\nrestricted to scheduled times, adding a time-sensitive\nelement to routing.\n\u2022 When a transfer is required for serving a customer, the\nstation must be visited to pick up the transferred item,\nand the station transferring the item must also be visited\nby the designated vehicle.\nThe operational dynamics of VRP-UT are illustrated in\nFigure 2, which contrasts traditional ground-level delivery\nwith the integrated underground transfer system. n the tradi-\ntional approach, illustrated by the example of vehicle routing\nproblems with inventory constraints (VRP-IC) in Figure 2(a),\nwarehouses directly service customers via ground routes.\nIn contrast, the integrated VRP-UT approach (Figure 2(b))\nuses underground stations as intermediate nodes for redis-\ntributing goods, reducing the need for long-distance ground\ntravel. This ensures that goods are moved closer to their final\ndestinations before the last leg of delivery.\nBy combining surface and underground logistics, the\nVRP-UT model offers a flexible and efficient solution for\nurban logistics challenges. The use of underground stations\nfor inventory transfers reduces surface traffic, speeds up deliv-\neries, and enhances overall logistics efficiency, particularly in\ncongested city environments.\nA.

The set W denotes the warehouse\nnodes crucial to the distribution network. The set I corre-\nsponds to the customer nodes, which are the destinations\nfor the goods transported. Additionally, the set S represents\nstation nodes that play an integral role in the logistics process,\nparticularly within the underground logistics segment.\nMoreover, the set N encompasses all nodes in the network.\nIt is defined as the union of warehouse, delivery, and station\nnodes, formally represented as N = W \u222a I \u222a S. The set A\ncomprises all feasible arcs (i, j) in the network, where i and\nj are distinct nodes in N. For underground logistics, the set\nU G represents the arcs between underground stations.\nSystemic parameters are pivotal in defining the dynamics\nof the problem. The parameter Ti j specifies the travel time\nbetween any two nodes i and j, assuming the shortest path.\nThe cost parameters, CT and CU , represent the per-unit travel\ntime costs for vehicles on the surface and underground, respec-\ntively. Additionally, Wv, Wi, and W Inv\ni denote the designated\nwarehouses for vehicles, deliveries, and inventory respectively.\nThe parameter schedule sch provides the available schedules\nfor underground travel between stations.\nKey decision variables include xvi j, a binary variable that is\n1 if vehicle v travels from node i to node j, and 0 otherwise.\nThe variables t T\nvi, tU\ndrop,s, and tU\npick,s capture the travel time for\nvehicles at node i and the drop and pick times at station s,\nrespectively. The variable zs,s\u2032 is a binary variable indicating\nwhether an inventory transfer occurs from station s to s\u2032. The\nvariable Usch ,s,s\u2032 represents the selection of a specific schedule\nsch for underground inventory transfers between stations s and\ns\u2032. Lastly, C) denotes the completion time after all deliveries\nare completed and returning to each depot.\nB. Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Formulation\nWe now formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear\nprogram (MILP), where the objective is to minimize the total\ncompletion time.\n1) Objective Function: The primary goal of the model,\nas presented in Equation (1), is to minimize the total comple-\ntion time. This objective focuses on optimizing vehicle routing\nin combination with underground logistics.This objective seeks\nto minimize the total completion time across all vehicles,\ndenoted by C.\nminimize C (1)\n2) Constraints:\na) Truck movement constraints: Constraint (2) ensures\nthat each delivery is assigned to exactly one vehicle. This\nguarantees that every customer node is visited by one and\nonly one vehicle. Constraint (3) restricts vehicles to only serve\ndeliveries originating from their designated warehouses. This\nensures that vehicles adhere to their respective warehouse\nassignments and do not deliver goods from other warehouses.\nConstraints (4) and (5) ensure that each vehicle starts and\nreturns to its assigned warehouse. Vehicles must leave and\nreturn to their designated depot, ensuring efficient and logical\nroutes. This restriction enforces the rule that vehicles are\nconfined to their respective warehouse routes. Constraint (6)\nenforces flow balance at each node. For every vehicle, the\nnumber of arcs entering a node must equal the number of arcs\nleaving the node, ensuring proper flow continuity throughout\nthe network.\n\u2211\nv\u2208V\n\u2211\nj\u2208N\nxvji = 1 \u2200i \u2208 I (2)\n\u2211\nv\u2208V\n\u2211\nj\u2208N\nxvji = 0 \u2200i \u2208 I, v \u0338= wi (3)\n\u2211\nj\u2208N\nxvw j = 1 \u2200v \u2208 V (4)\n6398 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 5, MAY 2025\n\u2211\nj\u2208N\nxvjw = 1 \u2200v \u2208 V (5)\n\u2211\nj\u2208N\nxvji =\n\u2211\nj\u2208N\nxvi j \u2200v \u2208 V, i \u2208 N (6)\nb) Time constraints for vehicles: Constraint (7) ensures\nthat the travel time between nodes i and j is consistent\nwith the actual travel duration. This guarantees that vehicles\nfollow realistic time frames for moving between locations.\nConstraint (8) calculates the arrival time of each vehicle at its\nwarehouse after completing all deliveries. This ensures that\nthe vehicle routing concludes with the vehicle returning to\nits initial starting warehouse. Constraint (9) defines the total\ncompletion time C as the maximum of all vehicle arrival\ntimes, which establishes the overall time required to finish\nthe delivery process for all vehicles.\nt T\nvj \u2265 t T\nvi + Ti j \u2212 M(1 \u2212 xvi j) \u2200v \u2208 V, (i, j) \u2208 A\n(7)\nt T\nav \u2265 t T\nvi + Tiwv \u2212 M(1 \u2212 xvi j) \u2200v \u2208 V, i \u2208 N (8)\nCcompletion \u2265 t T\nav \u2200v \u2208 V (9)\nc) Underground movement constraints: Constraint (10)\nensures that if the inventory required for a delivery is located\nin a different warehouse, the vehicle must visit the correspond-\ning drop station before making the delivery. Constraint (11)\nenforces that the vehicle also visits the pickup station associ-\nated with the delivery\u2019s designated warehouse. Constraint (12)\nguarantees that an underground transfer takes place between\nthe drop s and pickup s\u2032 stations when there is a warehouse\nmismatch.\n\u2211\nv\u2208V\n\u2211\nj\u2208N\nxv, j,sdrop \u2265 1 \u2200i \u2208 I, sdrop = W Inv\ni \u0338= Wi (10)\n\u2211\nv\u2208V\n\u2211\nj\u2208N\nxv, j,spickup \u2265 1 \u2200i \u2208 I, spickup = Wi \u0338= W Inv\ni (11)\nzsdrop,spickup \u2265 1 \u2200i \u2208 I, W Inventory\ni\n= sdrop, Wi = spickup (12)\nd) Underground travel time constraints: Constraint (13)\nensures Up,s,s\u2032 is set to 1 only if a valid schedule exists for a\ntransfer between stations s and s\u2032, synchronizing the transfer\nwith the schedule and zs,s\u2032. Building on this, Constraint (14)\naligns the drop time at station s with the departure time of\nthe schedule, avoiding delays. Similarly, Constraint (15) aligns\nthe pick-up time at station s\u2032 with the schedule\u2019s arrival time,\nensuring timely inventory transfers.\n\u2211\np\u2208P\nUp,s,s\u2032 = zss \u2032 \u2200s, s\u2032 \u2208 S (13)\nDptp \u2265 tU\ndrop,s \u2212 M(1 \u2212 Usch ,s,s\u2032 ) \u2200s \u2208 S (14)\ntU\npick,s\u2032 \u2265 Arrp \u2212 M(1 \u2212 Usch ,s,s\u2032 ) \u2200s\u2032 \u2208 S (15)\ne) Vehicle time constraints with underground transfers:\nTo ensure seamless coordination between vehicle schedules\nand underground transfer operations, we introduce constraints\nthat synchronize pick-up and drop-off times and address inven-\ntory mismatches. Constraint (16) ensures that when a vehicle v\nvisits station s, its pick-up time t T\nvs aligns with the underground\ntransfer\u2019s scheduled pick-up time tU\npick,s. Constraint (17) aligns\nthe vehicle\u2019s drop-off time at stations with its travel time from\nnode i, maintaining the correct sequence of movements.\nt T\nvs \u2265 tU\npick,s \u2212 M(1 \u2212 xvis ) \u2200v \u2208 V, s \u2208 S (16)\ntU\ndrop,s \u2265 t T\nvi + Tis \u2212 M(1 \u2212 xvis ) \u2200v \u2208 V, i \u2208 N (17)\nThe equations represent the core constraints of the model,\nensuring effective vehicle routing, time management, and\nsynchronization with the underground logistics network. These\nconstraints are designed to optimize the paths and schedules,\nultimately minimizing the total completion time C.\nIV. Q-L EARNING WITH PRUNING\nWe propose Q-learning with Pruning (QLP) as a solution\nto the computational challenges of the VRP-UT, an NP-hard\nextension of the classical VRP. The transfer-based vehicle\nrouting framework with time constraints presents immense\ncomplexity. Traditional reinforcement learning approaches\nencounter substantial difficulties with NP-hard problems due\nto the vast solution space and the challenge of locating optimal\nsolutions efficiently [38]. QLP integrates pruning directly into\nthe Q-learning process, dynamically reducing the solution\nspace by eliminating suboptimal routes. This focus on promis-\ning paths mitigates computational limitations, enabling more\nefficient exploration within this domain.\nThe core idea behind QLP is to prune routes that violate\nspecific optimality conditions, such as ensuring that the travel\ntime before reaching a transfer station does not exceed the\ndesignated transfer time. Additionally, QLP respects preemp-\ntion constraints, which require that specific nodes are visited\nin a predefined sequence following the station visit. By incor-\nporating pruning, QLP dynamically removes unviable paths,\nallowing the Q-learning algorithm to more efficiently explore\nthe solution space. The following sections outline how various\nmethods, including Greedy algorithms, Minimum Spanning\nTree limits, and pruning conditions, are applied within QLP\nto address the challenges of VRP-UT.\nA. Greedy Algorithm: Upper Limit for Feasibility\nIn the context of QLP, the Greedy Algorithm provides an\nessential upper limit, serving as a baseline estimate of the total\ntravel time. By generating a feasible solution with minimized\nimmediate travel time, this cap allows QLP to identify and\nprune routes that become excessively costly relative to heuris-\ntic limits.\nTheorem 1: Let C G represent the total cost of the route\ngenerated by the Greedy Algorithm (see Appendix A), and let\nC \u2217 denote the Hamiltonian cycle with the optimal cost for the\nrouting problem. Then the following inequality holds:\nC G \u2265 C \u2217,\nwhere C G is an upper limit on the optimal solution C \u2217 for the\nrouting problem for each warehouse.\nProof: Consider the vehicle routing problem, where:\n\u2022 V represents the set of nodes (deliveries and pickups) to\nbe visited by the vehicle.\nJEONG AND SONG: OPTIMIZING URBAN LOGISTICS: VRP-UT 6399\n\u2022 d(i, j) denotes the travel cost (e.g., distance or time)\nbetween nodes i and j, where i, j \u2208 V \u222a { 0}, and 0\nrepresents the depot.\nThe Greedy Algorithm constructs a feasible solution C G by\niteratively selecting the nearest unvisited node, thus minimiz-\ning the immediate travel cost at each step. Let the sequence\nof nodes visited by the greedy solution be denoted as:\n\u03c3 = {0, \u03c31, \u03c32, . . . , \u03c3n, 0},\nwhere 0 is the depot, and \u03c31, \u03c32, . . . , \u03c3n \u2208 V are the nodes\nvisited in the order generated by the Greedy Algorithm.\nThe total cost of the route produced by the Greedy\nAlgorithm is:\nC G =\nn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nd(\u03c3i , \u03c3i+1),\nwhere \u03c30 = 0 and \u03c3n+1 = 0 (i.e., returning to the depot).\nBy definition, C \u2217, the optimal cost, is the minimum possible\ncost that visits all nodes in V and returns to the depot:\nC \u2217 = min\n\u03c0\u22085\nn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nd(\u03c0i , \u03c0i+1),\nwhere 5 represents the set of all possible permutations of the\nnodes in V , and \u03c0 is one such permutation.\nSince the Greedy Algorithm does not necessarily mini-\nmize the global route cost (it selects locally optimal moves),\nwe know that:\nC G \u2265 C \u2217.\nThus, C G provides an upper limit on the optimal solution C \u2217.\nB. Minimum Spanning Tree as a Lower Limit\nIn addition to an upper limit, establishing a lower limit is\nvital for efficient pruning in QLP. The MST represents the\nminimal route cost required to connect all nodes, helping QLP\nidentify when extending a route is unproductive and should be\npruned.\nLet M ST denote the weight of the MST of the graph G =\n(V, E), where V represents the set of delivery nodes and the\ndepot, and E represents the set of edges with distances d(i, j)\nbetween nodes i and j. The MST provides a lower limit on\nthe optimal route cost C \u2217 for the TSP:\nM ST \u2264 C \u2217.\nTheorem 2: The weight of the MST provides a lower limit\non the optimal route cost C \u2217 for the VRP-UT.\nProof: Let G = (V, E) be a complete undirected graph,\nand consider the optimal solution to the VRP-UT, denoted by\nC\u2217, which is a Hamiltonian cycle that:\n\u2022 Visits each node in V exactly once.\n\u2022 Starts and ends at the depot.\n\u2022 Has a total cost C \u2217.\nThe Hamiltonian cycle C\u2217 is a connected subgraph of G\nthat spans all nodes in V and forms a cycle. By removing any\nsingle edge from C\u2217, we obtain a spanning tree T \u2217 of G, and\nthe weight of this spanning tree satisfies:\nT \u2217 = C \u2217 \u2212 d(i, j),\nwhere d(i, j) is the weight of the removed edge from the\ncycle. Hence, the weight of the spanning tree is always less\nthan or equal to the cost of the Hamiltonian cycle:\nT \u2217 \u2264 C \u2217.\nSince the MST is the spanning tree with the minimum\npossible weight, we have:\nM ST \u2264 T \u2217.\nThus, combining these inequalities, we establish the follow-\ning relationship:\nM ST \u2264 C \u2217.\nTherefore, the weight of the MST provides a lower limit\non the optimal route cost C \u2217. The MST is computed using\nKruskal\u2019s Algorithm (see Appendix C), which is known for\nits efficiency in finding a spanning tree by selecting edges in\nnon-decreasing order of weight.\nC. Pruning for Optimal Transfer Efficiency\nIn VRP-UT with transfer constraints, pruning is essential\nfor reducing computational complexity by eliminating paths\nthat cannot contribute to an optimal solution. The primary\nobjective is to identify transfer scenarios that can be postponed\nor avoided, enhancing routing efficiency without sacrificing\noptimality.For clarity, in the following pruning conditions,\nLLL denotes the minimum required time for completion of\na route segment, based on the MST lower bound. Meanwhile,\nUUU represents an upper bound based on heuristic methods,\nproviding a cap on route costs. These limits guide pruning by\nhelping identify paths that exceed feasible cost thresholds.\n\u2022 r, r rest: the current incomplete route r and the remaining\nunvisited nodes for w1.\n\u2022 Rwi : the full set of customers associated with warehouse\nwi.\n\u2022 C(r ): the completion time of the current partial route r.\n\u2022 L(r ) and U( r ): the lower and upper limits on the com-\npletion time for route r, derived from MST and Greedy\nmethods, respectively.\n\u2022 T transfer(si , s j ): the transfer time between stations si and\ns j, which includes waiting time.\nBased on the incomplete route r, we determine whether to\nprune further exploration or continue with route adjustments.\nThe pruning scenarios below outline how unidirectional and\nbidirectional transfers impact this decision.\n1) Pruning Condition 1: Single-Directional Transfer: This\ncondition applies when transfers are required only from ware-\nhouse w1 to w2. We prune a partial router at w1 if extending it\nfurther will not yield an improvement. The pruning condition\nis met if the following inequalities hold:\nL(r rest) \u2265 U(Rw2 ) + T transfer(s1, s2),\n6400 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 5, MAY 2025\nFig. 3. Example of Pruning Condition 1: Single-Directional Transfer.\nSubfigure (a) shows the route structure, including partial and rest routes.\nSubfigure (b) illustrates the time variables in an example case.\nC(r ) + Tr,s1 + L(r rest) > U(Rw1),\nwhere r rest represents unvisited customers remaining after\nvisiting station s1 for transfer. If these conditions hold, the\npartial route r can be pruned, as extending it would not lead\nto an optimal solution.\nProof: Consider a scenario where a transfer from w1 to\nw2 is required without a reciprocal transfer. The upper limit\nof the completion time at w2 is represented as:\nC(Rw2) \u2264 U(Rw2) + C(r ) + Tr,s1 + T transfer(s1, s2).\nFor optimal solution alignment, w2 should initiate opera-\ntions in synchronization with the transfer timing. Meanwhile,\nthe lower bound for w1\u2019s completion time is:\nC(Rw1) \u2265 C(r ) + Tr,s1 + L(r rest).\nTo prevent suboptimal synchronization, we establish the\ncondition:\nC(Rw1) \u2265 C(Rw2),\nwhich leads to:\nL(r rest) \u2265 U(Rw2) + T transfer(s1, s2).\nThis inequality establishes that w1\u2019s completion time con-\nsistently exceeds that of w2. Consequently, to minimize w1\u2019s\ncompletion time, the following must also hold:\nC(r ) + Tr,s1 + L(r rest) \u2264 U(Rw1).\nWhen this condition is not met, the partial route r would\nexceed U( Rw1), resulting in a suboptimal solution even if it\ndoes not affect the total completion time.\nC(r ) + Tr,s1 + L(r rest) > U(Rw1),\nThus, this inequality confirms that extending the current\npartial route r would lead to non-optimal outcomes, justifying\npruning. By removing such routes, we focus QLP\u2019s exploration\non paths that have potential for improved efficiency.\nFig. 4. Example of Pruning Condition 1: Bi-Directional Transfer. Subfigure\n(a) depicts the route structure having bi-directional movement between sta-\ntions. Subfigure (b) illustrates the time variables including example case.\n2) Pruning Condition 2: Transfer Synchronization Without\nUnknown Delay: This condition applies when transfers are\nrequired in both directions, from s1 to s2 and from s2 to s1.\nThe aim is to prevent a mismatch in completion times between\nwarehouses that would cause inefficiency due to extended\nwaiting. We prune the current route r if extending it results\nin delayed transfer synchronization, based on the following\ninequalities:\nU(r rest) \u2264 L(Rw2) + C(r ) + Tr,s1,\nC(r ) + Tr,s1 + L(r rest) > U(Rw1),\nProof: For synchronized completion times, we must\nensure that w1\u2019s transfer does not lag w2\u2019s. Thus, we require:\nC(Rw1) \u2265 C(Rw2),\nleading to:\nL(r rest) + T transfer(s1, s2) \u2265 U(Rw2) + C(r ) + Tr,s1.\nBy assuming T transfer(s1, s2) \u2265 C(r ) + Tr,s1, we simplify\nthis condition as:\nL(r rest) \u2265 U(Rw2) + C(r ) + Tr,s1 .\nAdditionally, for the completion time of w1 to remain below\nupper limit, the following inequality must hold:\nC(r ) + Tr,s1 + L(r rest) \u2264 U(Rw1 ),\nwhich ensures that extending route r would exceed w1\u2019s\nfeasible completion time upper bound, U( Rw1), confirming\nthat this path does not contribute to an optimal solution.\nC(r ) + Tr,s1 + L(r rest) > U(Rw1),\nJEONG AND SONG: OPTIMIZING URBAN LOGISTICS: VRP-UT 6401\nTo maintain optimal timing between w1 and w2, this\ncondition ensures that any route that extends beyond this\nsynchronization threshold does not need further exploration,\nas it cannot contribute to an optimal solution. This pruning\ncriterion prevents inefficiencies caused by mismatched com-\npletion times across warehouses.\nD. Q-Learning With Pruning\nQLP is a reinforcement learning approach tailored to the\ncomplexities of the VRP-UT. QLP leverages reinforcement\nlearning to explore feasible routes effectively, incorporating\ndynamic pruning conditions that reduce the solution space by\ndiscarding routes violating feasibility or efficiency constraints.\nIn each iteration, the agent observes the current state, selects\nan action, and receives feedback as a reward [65]. This reward\nupdates the Q-table\u2014a matrix storing the utility of state-action\npairs\u2014according to the Bellman equation:\nQt+1(s, a)\n= Qt (s, a) + \u03b1\n[\nr (s, a) + \u03b3 max\na\u2032\nQ(s\u2032, a\u2032) \u2212 Qt (s, a)\n]\n,\nwhere:\n\u2022 Q(s, a): the expected utility of taking action a in state s,\n\u2022 \u03b1: the learning rate, controlling the degree to which new\ninformation overrides the old,\n\u2022 r (s, a): the reward received after performing action a in\nstate s,\n\u2022 s\u2032: the state reached after taking action a,\n\u2022 \u03b3 : the discount factor, which determines the weight of\nfuture versus immediate rewards.\n\u2022 maxa\u2032 Q(s\u2032, a\u2032): the maximum Q-value for the next state\ns\u2032, guiding optimal future decisions.\nTo balance exploration and exploitation, the QLP employs\nan \u03f5-greedy policy in Q-learning. The \u03f5-greedy method\nensures that the agent has a chance to explore the solu-\ntion space thoroughly, while gradually focusing on the most\npromising routes as learning progresses [57]. The value of \u03f5\ndecays over time, allowing the agent to prioritize exploitation\nin later stages.\n\u03c0(s ) =\n{\na\u2217, with probability 1 \u2212 \u03f5,\naa, with probability \u03f5, (18)\nwhere \u03c0(s ) is the decision policy for the current state s, a\u2217\nis the best estimated action for the state s at the current time,\nand aa is a random action selected with probability \u03f5.\nIn summary, QLP offers an efficient approach to solving the\nVRP-UT. By integrating two distinct pruning conditions, QLP\nreduces the solution space dynamically, effectively guiding\nthe Q-learning agent towards optimal routes without extensive\nexploration. The result is a method that balances efficient\ndecision-making with the flexibility to adapt in uncertain\ntransfer conditions, demonstrating how reinforcement learning\ncan address NP-hard problems with complex routing and\ntiming constraints.\nAlgorithm 1 Q-Learning With Pruning\n1: procedure QLP\n2: Set the parameters\n3: Initialize Q-table Q(s, a) = 0 for all state-action pairs\n4: if transfer required then\n5: Initialize distance matrices including station\n6: else\n7: Build distance matrices excluding station\n8: end if\n9: Generate initial solution using a greedy algorithm\n10: for each warehouse w do\n11: for each episode t do\n12: Observe current s\n13: Select a using \u03f5-greedy policy\n14: Take a and receive immediate r (s, a)\n15: Observe s\u2032\n16: if Pruning Condition 1 holds then\n17: Prune paths\n18: else if Pruning Condition 2 holds then\n19: Prune paths\n20: end if\n21: Update Q(s, a) using the Bellman equation\n22: Transition to the new state s\u2032\n23: end for\n24: end for\n25: Calculate travel time and latency for each route\n26: Update preemption nodes based on pruning decisions\n27: Output final solution\n28: end procedure\nV. N UMERICAL ANALYSIS\nThe computational analysis of the VRP-UT forms a crit-\nical component of this study, providing insights into the\npractical applicability and efficiency of the proposed model.\nThis section details the experimental setup and the resultant\nanalysis obtained from implementing the VRP-UT model and\ndesigning heuristics.\nA. Experimental Settings\nIn our research, the experimental setup is meticulously\ncalibrated to capture the intricacies of urban logistics net-\nworks. The simulation begins with the strategic placement\nof warehouses. These are fixed at coordinates (10, 10), (40,\n10), and for a scenario involving a third warehouse, at (25,\n30), ensuring distinct service areas with a 9km radius to\navoid service overlap. The customer delivery points and station\ncoordinates are generated randomly within these predefined\nradii. 10 replicated instances for each problem size are created\nto bolster the robustness of our approach against various\nurban configurations. This randomness in customer locations\nand their association with specific warehouses is designed to\nreflect the distribution patterns seen in metropolitan logistics\nactivities.\nIn each scenario, the VRP-UT model adopts a probabilistic\napproach to enhance realism in problem instance settings, par-\nticularly regarding customer inventory allocation constraints.\n6402 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 5, MAY 2025\nTABLE I\nDETAIL RESULTS OF THE EXAMPLE OPTIMAL SOLUTION\nFig. 5. Computational results of VRP-UT: (a) Completion time, (b) travel distance, (c) VKT per customer, and (d) waiting time.\nThis method considers a 50% chance that inventory may not be\nsourced from the customer\u2019s nearest warehouse, introducing a\nvariable that accurately mirrors real-world logistics scenarios\nwhere stock redistribution is routine. For analytical consis-\ntency, travel costs and velocities for vehicles and underground\ntransport are initially set to a unitary rate. This uniformity\nis purposefully employed to enable a baseline for comparative\nanalyses across different routing strategies. Later, in our sensi-\ntivity analysis, these cost and velocity parameters are varied to\nunderstand the model\u2019s responsiveness to different operational\nconditions.\nThe computational experiments are powered by a state-of-\nthe-art processing unit, leveraging the advanced capabilities of\nthe Gurobi Optimizer and Python to ensure that our modeling\nand algorithmic evaluations are executed within a robust\ncomputational framework. Each experiment is constrained by\na maximum computation time of 3600 seconds (1 hour) to\nensure consistency and practical feasibility across all instances.\nThis setup allows us to accurately assess the efficacy of various\nheuristic approaches in managing the dynamic and complex\nenvironment that is the VRP-UT.\nB. Model Verification\nThe behavior of the VRP-UT model was examined across\nscenarios involving 5, 10, 15, and 20 randomly distributed\ncustomers with either 2 or 3 warehouses. The vehicles and\nunderground transfer system operated at a uniform speed of\n30 km/h, and the underground transfers adhered to a fixed\nschedule, with departures and arrivals at 10-minute intervals.\nFigure 6 illustrates the optimal routing solutions for differ-\nent problem sizes, while Table I presents detailed temporal\ndata for the optimal route from scenario (a) in Figure 6.\nFig. 6. Optimal solutions from VRP-UT for 2-Warehouse 5-Customers.\nIn this particular solution, an underground transfer from station\n8 to station 7 was necessary, as customers 2 and 6\u2014who\nwere assigned to warehouse 0 ( Wi = 0)\u2014required products\nstored in warehouse 1 ( W Inv\ni = 1). Vehicle 1 transported\nthese products to station 8, where they were dropped off\nat the underground transfer system at the scheduled drop\ntime (t U\ndrop,s). The goods were then transferred to station 7,\nwhere vehicle 0 picked them up at the pickup time (t U\npick,s),\nwhich coincided with the arrival time of the underground\ntransfer. The vehicle subsequently completed the deliveries to\ncustomers 2 and 6.\nTo rigorously assess the scalable operational impact of ULS\non urban traffic congestion, we employed the metric Vehicle\nKilometers Traveled (VKT) per customer [12]. This measure\ndirectly highlights the traffic contribution of each delivery,\noffering a precise gauge of congestion potential per service\ninstance. Below is the formal mathematical definition for VKT\nper customer:\nVKT per customer =\n\u2211\nv\u2208V\n\u2211\n(i, j)\u2208A Di j \u00b7 xvi j\n|I | (19)\nJEONG AND SONG: OPTIMIZING URBAN LOGISTICS: VRP-UT 6403\nThis formula calculates the total vehicle kilometers traveled\nby all vehicles across all routes, normalized by the number of\ncustomers, |I |, to reflect the average traffic load each customer\ncontributes to the urban system.\nFigure 5 present the computational results of the VRP-UT\nmodel across different instance sizes, focusing on completion\ntime, travel distances, VKT per customer, and waiting times.\nAcross all scenarios, completion times increase as the num-\nber of customers grows, with 3-warehouse scenarios generally\nshowing shorter times compared to 2-warehouse cases. This\nhighlights the efficiency of ULS integration, which improves\nresource allocation and reduces total delivery times. Travel\ndistances remained stable for surface vehicles in 2-warehouse\nscenarios but increased notably for underground travel in\nthe 3-warehouse cases as customer numbers rose. This sug-\ngests that the added complexity of multiple warehouses leads\nto more underground transfers, increasing operational costs.\nMeanwhile, VKT per customer decreased by up to 60% as\nthe number of customers increased, indicating the potential for\nULS to reduce surface congestion. Waiting time, defined as the\ntime spent waiting for the underground transfer to arrive, was\nsignificantly higher in the 3-warehouse scenarios, likely due\nto the added complexity of coordinating multiple underground\ntransfers.\nIn addition to the operational metrics, CPU time for the\nVRP-UT model increased exponentially as the problem size\ngrew, particularly for instances involving 15 customers, where\nmany cases reached the computational limit of 3600 seconds.\nThis highlights the rising computational complexity of the\nmodel as more customers and transfers are incorporated.\nFurther details on the computational result are provided in\nAppendix E.\nC. Solution Comparison of VRP-UT With VRP-IC\nA key feature of VRP-UT is its underground logistics, which\nfacilitates the exchange and replenishment of inventories,\ncatering to specific customer demands. To evaluate VRP-\nUT\u2019s efficiency, we conducted a comparative analysis with\nVRP-IC. Unlike VRP-UT, this model excludes underground\nlogistics and focuses on direct service from warehouses while\nadhering to inventory capacities. VRP-IC operates exclusively\non surface networks, not leveraging the operational efficiencies\nof underground logistics. This model, detailed in Appendix B,\nrequires precise planning and operates exclusively on sur-\nface networks, not leveraging the operational efficiencies of\nunderground logistics. Although the specific constraints differ,\nVRP-IC aligns with variations of Vehicle Routing Problem\nwith Multiple Products and Time Windows (VRP-MPTW),\nas discussed in research by Coelho and Laporte [31], Kabcome\nand Mouktonglang [7].\nFigure 7 visually compares the optimal routing solutions for\nVRP-UT and VRP-IC in scenarios with 2 and 3 warehouses\nserving 10 customers. In the VRP-UT scenarios (Figures 7(a)\nand 7(c)), vehicles minimize extensive travel outside their\ndesignated warehouse areas by utilizing nearby underground\nstations for transferring goods. This results in shorter vehicle\ntravel paths, as indicated by the blue lines. In contrast, the\nVRP-IC scenarios (Figures 7(b) and 7(d)) lack the option\nFig. 7. Optimal solutions 10 customers cases from MILP for 2-Warehouse\nof (a) VRP-UT, (b) VRP-IC, and 3-Warehouse of (c) VRP-UT, (d) VRP-IC.\nof underground stations, forcing vehicles to travel longer\ndistances to serve customers outside their warehouse areas.\nConsequently, the vehicle routes in VRP-IC are significantly\nlonger than those in VRP-UT, underscoring the operational\n6404 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 5, MAY 2025\nTABLE II\nPARAMETER SETTINGS FOR HEURISTIC\nefficiency of integrating underground logistics into urban vehi-\ncle routing systems.\nThe comparative analysis results, illustrated in Figure 8,\ndemonstrate the operational advantages of integrating under-\nground logistics into urban vehicle routing. The VRP-UT\nmodel shows superior performance in terms of delivery time,\ntravel distance, and VKT per customer. In terms of time\nsavings, utilizing 2 warehouses results in approximately 20%\nsavings, while 3 warehouses achieve almost 30% savings.\nIn terms of VKT per customer, the VRP-UT model achieves an\naverage reduction of 55%. This significant decrease indicates a\nsubstantial reduction in traffic congestion, with surface vehicle\ntravel notably minimized, contributing to less potential traffic\nbuildup. However, as the instance size increases, underground\ntravel distance and waiting time also tend to rise. Therefore,\ncareful assessment of operational conditions is necessary to\nensure the economic viability of the system.\nOverall, the VRP-UT model not only proves to be opera-\ntionally efficient but also emerges as a sustainable and strategic\nsolution for urban traffic management. Detailed numerical\nresults from the experiments are provided in Appendix F.\nD. Comparison of Heuristic Approaches With Exact Solution\nThis section provides a comparative evaluation of various\nheuristic approaches, including the newly proposed QLP,\nas well as well-established meta-heuristics such as Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Particle\nSwarm Optimization (PSO). The performance of each\nheuristic is assessed using its optimality ratio, which\nmeasures the deviation from the optimal solution derived\nthrough MILP. These heuristics are further compared to the\nexact solution obtained via the MILP method, solved using\nthe Gurobi commercial solver [17]. The comparison is carried\nout on instances with up to 15 customers. Table II summarizes\nthe parameter settings that were fine-tuned for each method to\nensure optimal performance in solving the VRP-UT. Detailed\nadaptations of each heuristic for the VRP-UT, along with their\ncorresponding pseudo-codes, can be found in APPENDIX D.\nFigure 9 and Table III show the computational results for\nvarious problem sizes, focusing on the optimality gap and\ncomputational time. Among the heuristic approaches, the QLP\napproach performs the best overall, with an average optimality\ngap of 4.47%, closely followed by SA with a gap of 4.51%.\nGA and PSO show slightly higher optimality gaps compared\nto QLP and SA. While the differences in optimality are\nrelatively small among these methods, QL-pruning emerges\nas the superior approach in terms of computational efficiency,\nachieving substantially shorter computation times. In addition,\nQL-pruning stands out not only in terms of optimality but also\nin terms of computational efficiency, significantly reducing the\ncomputation time compared to the other methods. Even when\ncompared with the second-fastest heuristic, SA, QL-pruning\nreduces the computational time by over 99.7.\nOn the other hand, the exact approach with MILP exhibits\nan exponential increase in CPU time as the problem size\nincreases, becoming impractical for the 15-customer cases.\nAs a result, in the next section, we compare the performance\nof heuristics exclusively, as MILP is not feasible for larger\ninstances.\nE. Numerical Comparison Between Heuristic Approaches\nThis section evaluates the performance of various solution\napproaches when applied to large-scale problem instances,\nwhere the number of customers ranges from 5 to 100. The\nnumber of warehouses was fixed at either 2 or 3, and all\nother parameters were consistent with those outlined in earlier\nsections. Due to the computational limitations of MILP in\nhandling large-scale problems, our analysis focuses on the\nefficiency of heuristic approaches, specifically QLP, GA, SA,\nand PSO.\nFigure 10 illustrates the results for instances with up to\n100 customers, highlighting both the objective values and\nCPU times for each heuristic. In most cases, the objective\nvalue increased with the number of customers, and QLP\ndemonstrated superior performance across most instances.\nNotably, the performance gap between QLP and other heuris-\ntics increased as the problem size grew. On average, QLP\noutperformed SA by approximately 20%, with the gap widen-\ning to 46% in the largest instances. In terms of computational\ntime, QLP showed consistently shorter computation times,\nexcept for smaller problem sizes where all heuristics per-\nformed similarly. While SA performed marginally faster in\nsome of the larger instances, Q-Learning remained competi-\ntive, providing a better balance between solution quality and\ncomputational efficiency. As problem sizes increased, other\nheuristics such as GA and PSO showed a significant rise in\nboth objective value and computational time, especially in\ninstances involving 50 or more customers.\nThis analysis underscores the scalability and efficiency of\nQ-Learning with pruning in solving large instances, making\nit a more practical choice for real-world applications where\ncomputational resources are limited and optimal decision-\nmaking is required within constrained time frames.\nF . Sensitivity Analysis With Case Study\nIn this sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the impact of\nvarying underground transfer speeds and frequencies on deliv-\nery performance.

Two\nscenarios were examined: one involving two warehouses at\nJi-Juk and Hakyeoul stations, and the other involving three\nwarehouses utilizing all stations.\nAs demonstrated in Figure 12 increasing the speed of\nunderground transfers significantly reduces overall completion\ntime, resulting in greater delivery time savings compared\nto traditional methods. This improvement can be largely\nattributed to reduced waiting times, as faster transfer speeds\ndecrease overall logistics time. However, while delivery times\nimproved, the variability in VKT remained unpredictable,\nsuggesting that factors other than transfer speed and frequency\nmay influence surface travel distances.\nAn important aspect of the analysis is the transfer frequency,\nwhich is the interval between available underground transfers.\nThe results indicate that as the interval between transfers\nincreases (i.e., lower frequency), delivery times also increase,\ndiminishing the time-saving benefits due to longer waiting\ntimes. Interestingly, VKT appears relatively unaffected by\nchanges in transfer frequency, indicating that the distance\ntraveled by surface vehicles is not heavily influenced by\nunderground logistics operations. Detailed sensitivity analysis\nvalues are provided in Appendix H.\nThis analysis is particularly relevant for dense urban areas\nlike Seoul, where underground transportation systems such\nas the subway are integral to daily commuting and could\nbe leveraged to enhance logistics efficiency. Optimizing sub-\nway schedules and speeds can significantly impact last-mile\ndelivery services, reducing both traffic congestion and envi-\nronmental impact.\nG. Management Insights\nThe results from the sensitivity analysis and case study con-\nducted in Seoul offer key insights for urban logistics managers,\ntransport planners, and policymakers, enabling them to opti-\nmize last-mile delivery operations and integrate underground\ntransport systems into urban environments. These findings are\nparticularly valuable for decision-makers looking to improve\ndelivery efficiency while managing the limitations of urban\ninfrastructure.\nBased on the sensitivity analysis and case study results,\nwe can derive several actionable insights for urban logistics\npractitioners and policymakers:\n1) Transfer Speed and Delivery Efficiency : Increasing\nthe speed of underground transfers significantly reduces\ndelivery times. For example, when the transfer speed\nincreases from 30 km/h to 150 km/h, delivery time\nis reduced by approximately 29%. In addition, time\nsavings compared to traditional truck delivery increase\nfrom 27% to 49%, demonstrating substantial efficiency\nimprovements. For logistics companies, this highlights\nthe importance of collaborating with public transport\nauthorities or investing in infrastructure to support faster\nunderground transfer speeds. Faster transfers not only\nJEONG AND SONG: OPTIMIZING URBAN LOGISTICS: VRP-UT 6407\nFig. 12. Results of the sensitivity analysis: (a) Completion time, (b) Time savings, (c) Waiting time, (d) VKT per customer with varying velocities of\nunderground transfer, and (e) Completion time, (f) Time savings, (g) Waiting time, (h) VKT per customer with varying frequencies of underground transfer.\nhelp alleviate congestion but also improve delivery times\nand lower operational costs, which can give companies\na competitive advantage in the market.\n2) Impact of Transfer Frequency:\nThe frequency of underground transfers also plays a\ncrucial role in improving delivery efficiency. When the\ninterval between transfers is reduced from 15 minutes\nto 3 minutes, delivery times decrease by 9.8%, and\ntime savings increase by 16.1%. This shows that more\nfrequent transfers can significantly speed up deliveries\nand reduce customer waiting times. Urban logistics\nmanagers should focus on ensuring high-frequency\nunderground transfers, particularly during peak hours.\nCollaboration with public transport authorities to align\ndelivery schedules with available underground transfers\nwill be key to maximizing delivery performance, espe-\ncially in crowded urban areas.\n3) Scalability and Expansion Potential:\nExpanding the number of integrated underground sta-\ntions from two to three results in a 7.5% reduction in\ndelivery time and a 70% increase in time savings. This\ndemonstrates the scalability potential of underground\nlogistics systems. For both logistics companies and city\nplanners, this means that investing in expanding under-\nground logistics infrastructure can significantly enhance\ndelivery efficiency. While adding more stations may\nslightly increase waiting times, the overall impact on\ndelivery times remains highly beneficial. Urban planners\nand logistics companies should advocate for long-term\ncollaboration between public and private sectors to inte-\ngrate logistics operations into the growing underground\ntransport networks, ensuring that infrastructure expan-\nsion keeps pace with rising demand for faster deliveries.\n4) Limited Impact on Surface Travel Distance:\nDespite improvements in underground transfer speed\nand frequency, surface travel distances (measured as\nVehicle-Kilometers Traveled, or VKT) remain largely\nunaffected. This suggests that while underground trans-\nfer efficiency improves, other factors, such as traffic\nconditions and surface road infrastructure, still play\na significant role in determining overall delivery per-\nformance. Urban logistics managers need to account\nfor these factors when planning delivery routes and\nintegrating underground logistics with existing surface\ntransportation systems. This insight emphasizes the need\nfor a holistic approach to logistics that considers both\nunderground and surface-level transportation challenges.\nThese insights offer practical guidance for urban logis-\ntics managers and city planners. By leveraging underground\ntransport systems, logistics companies can reduce operational\ncosts, improve delivery speeds, and enhance the efficiency of\nlast-mile delivery. Additionally, policymakers can use these\nfindings to plan for scalable infrastructure that meets the\ngrowing demand for urban deliveries while reducing the\nnegative impacts of congestion and improving sustainability.\nBy focusing on the optimization of transfer speeds, frequen-\ncies, and system scalability, urban areas can create more\nefficient, sustainable logistics systems that are better suited\nto the demands of modern urban life.\nVI. C ONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\nThis study introduced the VRP-UT, a novel model that\nintegrates traditional vehicle routing with ULS to address the\nchallenges of urban congestion, operational efficiency, and\nsustainability. We explored the impact of incorporating ULS,\nparticularly the use of real-world subway systems and sched-\nules, into delivery logistics. Our model was further enhanced\nby the introduction of a novel QLP approach, designed to\noptimize route decisions and streamline operations by reducing\nunnecessary transfers.\nOur findings demonstrate the significant potential of\nthe VRP-UT model to reduce surface-level congestion by\n6408 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 5, MAY 2025\ndiverting a considerable portion of delivery traffic under-\nground. Specifically, the model achieved a reduction in VKT\nby approximately 50% compared to traditional vehicle routing\nmodels such as VRP-IC. The use of underground links for\ninventory transfers alleviated surface-level congestion, par-\nticularly in densely populated areas. Moreover, the model\nshowed notable operational cost savings, especially as the\nnumber of warehouses increased, highlighting its economic\nviability for urban logistics. The inclusion of real subway\nschedules into the model ensured that underground transfers\nwere synchronized with surface deliveries, improving overall\nlogistics coordination. Sensitivity analyses revealed that faster\nunderground transfer velocities could reduce completion times\nby up to 50%, further improving delivery speed and reducing\ncongestion.\nWe also proposed a novel QLP approach that dynami-\ncally reduces the search space by eliminating unnecessary\noperations. This approach was validated through comparisons\nwith traditional heuristics like GA, SA, and PSO, consistently\nachieving superior optimality while maintaining lower compu-\ntational time. The Q-learning-based method proved effective in\nmanaging the complexity introduced by underground transfer\nschedules and multiple delivery nodes. A comprehensive case\nstudy based on Seoul\u2019s subway Line 3 was conducted to vali-\ndate the model\u2019s practicality. By incorporating actual subway\nmaps, depot locations, and scheduling data, the case study\nprovided insights into the real-world applicability of VRP-\nUT, offering practical results on how underground logistics\ncan integrate with traditional vehicle routes.\nWhile this research makes important contributions, certain\nlimitations must be acknowledged. The model assumes fixed\nunderground schedules and does not account for real-time\ntraffic variability or disruptions in subway services. Future\nresearch could explore the dynamic adaptation of schedules\nusing real-time data, as well as the integration of other emerg-\ning technologies like aerial drones and autonomous vehicles\nto complement underground logistics. Further research could\nalso investigate the environmental impacts of underground\nlogistics, focusing on emission reductions and energy savings,\nalong with the policy frameworks needed for ULS implemen-\ntation. Additionally, exploring the role of advanced AI and\nIoT technologies in enhancing the intelligence and efficiency\nof underground logistics systems would be a valuable avenue\nfor future investigation.\nIn conclusion, this study represents a transformative\napproach to urban logistics, offering both theoretical advance-\nments through the VRP-UT model and practical insights\nthrough real-world validation. The model aligns with sustain-\nable urban development goals and provides a robust framework\nfor addressing the growing challenges of last-mile delivery in\ndensely populated urban areas.\nAPPENDIX\nA. Greedy Algorithm\nThe Greedy Algorithm for VRP-UT lays the foundation\nfor initial solution generation. For classical VRPs with time\nwindows, the greedy algorithm has been shown to provide\nimproved initial feasible solutions [5], [18], [27]. Given VRP-\nUT\u2019s specific feasibility constraints on pickups and deliveries,\nthe algorithm is designed to visit the station whenever drop-off\nor pickup is necessitated, followed by the construction of\nroutes by choosing the nearest unvisited delivery point from\neach warehouse, focusing on minimizing immediate travel\ncosts and times. This simple yet effective algorithm provides\na solid base for more complex heuristic algorithms by offer-\ning a practical starting solution that aligns with the unique\nconstraints of VRP-UT.\nAlgorithm 2 Greedy Algorithm\n1: procedure GREEDY\n2: Initialize by loading input data\n3: for each warehouse w \u2208 W do\n4: Define customers/pickup/drop for warehouse w\n5: Initialize route for warehouse w\n6: while there exist unvisited customers do\n7: Update route with nearest remaining customer\n8: end while\n9: Deconstruct the first visit\n10: Reconstruct the route with a station visit\n11: Update total route to return to warehouse\n12: end for\n13: Combine routes from all warehouses\n14: Calculate total operational cost and completion time\n15: Save and return results\n16: end procedure\nB.

Kruskal\u2019s Algorithm for MST\nKruskal\u2019s Algorithm is a greedy method for finding the\nMinimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected\ngraph. It begins by initializing a forest where each vertex is\na separate tree and creates a sorted list of all edges based on\ntheir weights. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest\nedge that connects two different trees, adding it to the MST\nand merging the trees, until V \u2212 1 edges are included, where\nV is the number of vertices.\nThe time complexity of Kruskal\u2019s Algorithm is domi-\nnated by the edge sorting step, resulting in O(E log E) or\nO(E log V ), where E is the number of edges. Union-find\noperations can be performed in nearly constant time, making\nthe overall complexity efficient. Compared to NP-hard prob-\nlems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Kruskal\u2019s\nAlgorithm offers a simpler and more efficient approach, mak-\ning it suitable for various applications in network design and\nclustering.\nD. Heuristic Approaches\nThe VRP-UT extends the classical multi-depot VRP by\nincorporating inventory constraints and time windows, intro-\nducing additional complexity by managing pickups, drops,\nAlgorithm 4 Genetic Algorithm for VRP-UT\n1: procedure GA\n2: Initialize by loading input data and GA parameters\n3: for each warehouse w \u2208 W do\n4: Define customers/pickup/drop for this warehouse\n5: Define genetic representation and evaluation\n6: Generate initial population including greedy\n7: for a set number of generations do\n8: Evaluate fitness with penalty\n9: Perform Tournament Selection\n10: Apply crossover with crossover rate\n11: Apply mutation with mutation rate\n12: Update population with new generation\n13: end for\n14: Store the best solution found\n15: end for\n16: Combine optimized routes from all warehouses\n17: Calculate total operational cost and completion time\n18: Save and return results\n19: end procedure\nand transfers across underground stations. Considering the\nNP-hard nature of the standard VRP, the VRP-UT significantly\nescalates in complexity. This section introduces algorithms\ntailored to mitigate the complexity of VRP-UT, including the\nGreedy Algorithm for initial solution construction and well-\nknown search-based metaheuristic algorithms\u2014GA, SA, and\nPSO [2], [33], [35].\nGA, SA, and PSO are well-known to be efficient solution\napproaches that successfully address the high complexity of\ndifferent optimization problems. These algorithms are often\ncompared due to their well-known efficiency and distinctive\ncharacteristics [13], [14], [67]. They can be applied to opti-\nmization problems by tailoring the solution representations,\nsearch operators, and evaluation functions.\nTo tailor these heuristics for VRP-UT, we strategically\npartition the problem based on individual warehouses,\naccommodating inventory discrepancies that require\nspecific pickups or drop-offs. By addressing these\n6410 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 5, MAY 2025\nTABLE V\nCOMPUTATIONAL RESULTS IN THE VRP-UT O BTAINED THROUGH MILP\nTABLE VI\nCOMPARATIVE RESULTS OF VRP-IC AND VRP-UT\nAlgorithm 5 Simulated Annealing for VRP-UT\n1: procedure SA\n2: Initialize by loading input data and SA parameters\n3: for each warehouse w \u2208 W do\n4: Define customers/pickup/drop for this warehouse\n5: Generate initial greedy solution\n6: Set current solution to greedy solution\n7: Set initial temperature\n8: while temperature > minimum temperature do\n9: Generate neighboring solution\n10: Evaluate neighbor solution with penalty\n11: Apply acceptance criteria\n12: if neighbor solution is improved then\n13: Update current solution and cost\n14: end if\n15: Reduce temperature with cooling rate\n16: end while\n17: end for\n18: Combine optimized routes\n19: Calculate total operational cost and completion time\n20: Save and return results\n21: end procedure\nsegments, the heuristics coordinate the pickup and\ndelivery operations within the constraints of inventory and\ntiming.\nFigure 13 illustrates the heuristic algorithms\u2019 solution con-\nstruction sequence with the penalty approach. Initially, each\nheuristic\u2019s search operator adapts to find solutions. Then,\nunderground travel is constructed to accommodate inventory\ndiscrepancies. During the evaluation, solutions that violate the\nprecedence of the visiting sequence for customers requiring\ntransfer from other warehouses incur penalties in the objective\nvalue, steering the algorithms towards feasible solutions [1],\n[4], [15].\n1) Genetic Algorithm (GA): The GA is tailored explic-\nitly to VRP-UT\u2019s unique constraints, including mandatory\nAlgorithm 6 Particle Swarm Optimization for VRP-UT\n1: procedure PSO\n2: Initialize by loading input data and PSO parameters\n3: for each warehouse w \u2208 W do\n4: Define customers/pickup/drop for this warehouse\n5: Initialize particles with random routes\n6: Include a greedy solution in initial particle set\n7: for a set number of iterations do\n8: for each particle do\n9: Update velocity based on \u03c9, c1, and c2\n10: Update position\n11: Evaluate new position with penalty\n12: if new position is improved then\n13: Update particle\u2019s best position\n14: Update the global best position\n15: end if\n16: end for\n17: end for\n18: end for\n19: Combine optimized routes\n20: Calculate total operational cost and completion time\n21: Save and return results\n22: end procedure\nstation visits, pickups, drop-offs, deliveries, and precedence.\nThe algorithm initiates by partitioning the problem based\non different warehouses. Each segment generates an initial\npopulation comprising both randomly generated and greedy\nalgorithm-derived solutions. Incorporating a penalty function,\nthe GA evaluates the fitness of each individual. Tourna-\nment selection strategy [54] is employed to identify superior\nsolutions, while two-point crossover [59] and swap mutation\noperators [59] are applied to introduce variations. These pro-\ncesses balance exploring new solutions and exploiting efficient\nexisting routes. The population is continuously updated with\nnew generations, cycling through evaluation until reaching the\nfinal generation. After determining optimized routes for each\nJEONG AND SONG: OPTIMIZING URBAN LOGISTICS: VRP-UT 6411\nTABLE VII\nCOMPUTATIONAL RESULTS FOR DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS\nTABLE VIII\nSENSITIVITY ANALYSIS RESULTS FOR VARYING UNDERGROUND TRANSFER SPEEDS AND FREQUENCIES\nwarehouse, the algorithm constructs the underground travel\nsegments by combining these routes. Finally, it calculates the\ntotal operational cost and completion time, concluding by\nreturning the results.\n6412 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 5, MAY 2025\n2) Simulated Annealing (SA): Similarly, SA starts with ini-\ntialization and problem partitioning. Each warehouse segment\nbegins with a greedy solution and then methodically explores\nneighboring solutions to enhance routing. Governed by a\ncarefully designed cooling schedule, SA effectively avoids\nlocal optima, as detailed in the study by Vincent et al. [70].\nThis approach allows for a comprehensive solution space\nsearch, with minor variations in route plans being systemati-\ncally evaluated. New solutions are accepted based on specific\ncriteria, enabling the algorithm to uncover potentially global\noptimal solutions. SA concludes its process by combining\noptimized routes from each warehouse and calculating the total\noperational cost and completion time.\n3) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): PSO utilizes swarm\nintelligence principles, where each particle in the swarm\nrepresents a potential solution initially derived from a greedy\nalgorithm. As highlighted in the work of Marinakis et al.\n[44], the particles adjust their paths based on individual and\ncollective experiences. This balance between exploration and\nexploitation is crucial for PSO\u2019s effectiveness. The algorithm\nevaluates multiple routes simultaneously, considering the\ncomplex interplay between surface and underground station\nlogistics. Through iterative updates of particle positions, PSO\ndynamically searches for optimal solutions within the VRP-\nUT framework, concluding with aggregating these routes and\ncalculating total operational costs and completion times.\nE.
