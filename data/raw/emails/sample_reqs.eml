Hi Team,

For the new project, we specifically need the dashboard to support real-time data streaming from our internal API. It should be able to handle at least 50 concurrent users without latency issues.

Also, the UI must follow the "Corporate Noir" theme with glassmorphism effects.

Best,
Sarah
